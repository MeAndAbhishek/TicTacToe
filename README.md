# TicTacToe
A basic tic tac toe - game

This project is for learning javascript/typescript

## Expectations:
Game Modes: 
1. 2 player mode (Mandatory)
2. vs AI mode (Optional)
3. Majority of 3 matches to Win
4. A popup to take user input which for initial stage just includes user name of the player # (1 and 2) if 2 player and only #1 if vs Ai.
5. Game should start only after the input is given by the user.
6. It should have a score board where the result is updated after every move made. It should have current score, player names, X or O chosen by player on the board. It should be out of the game board and should be visible at all times.
7. Once a game is over (Win, Lose or Draw), the Scoreboard should be updated with the Winner and it should show the point difference. With an option to start a new game or restart a game.
8. If user chooses to Restart the game then the Current board will be reset but the data of the old game is to be shown in a table below the game board.
9. If user chooses to start a new game the the scoreboard will be simply reset and new player name inputs are to be taken using a popup.
10. In case of refresh the state should be preserved, but in case of tab close or browser close the game state should be reset. As in If the user chooses to refresh in the middle of the game, post refresh the game should continue. But in case the user closes the tab/browser the game should reset or stop.

Fair Warning: Dont focus too much on CSS. the UI should be usable though but functionality should work as per above given expectations.
Whats allowed: Whatever you like be it vanilla JS or TS or any other frontend framework.
